Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify fish diseases based on images. The system can detect whether a fish is diseased or healthy and provide relevant precautions for diseased fish. It is intended to help farmers quickly diagnose and manage the health of their fish in aquaculture environments.

Technologies Used
Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image classification.
Flask: For building the web application backend.
TensorFlow/Keras: For developing and training the CNN model.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For frontend development to allow users to upload fish images.
Pillow: For image processing in Python.
Numpy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
JavaScript: For file handling and AJAX requests to communicate with the Flask backend.
Model Architecture
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture
Input Layer: Images are resized to 224x224 pixels to match the input size required by the model.

Convolutional Layers: Multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activations for feature extraction.

Max Pooling Layers: Pooling layers to reduce dimensionality and retain important features.

Fully Connected Layer: A dense layer to classify the extracted features.

Output Layer: A softmax layer to predict the class of the fish (Healthy or Diseased).

Model architecture summary:

Conv2D → MaxPooling2D → Conv2D → MaxPooling2D → Flatten → Dense → Output
Dataset
The dataset used for training the CNN model contains images of both healthy and diseased fish. These images are categorized into two main directories:

Healthy: Images of healthy fish.
Diseased: Images of fish affected by various diseases.
Dataset Details:
Total images: Approximately 2,000 images (1,000 healthy, 1,000 diseased).
Image Format: JPG/PNG
Image Size: 224x224 pixels (resized for CNN input).
The dataset was used to train the CNN model to classify fish into two classes: Healthy and Diseased.

Precautions for Diseased Fish
If the model predicts that a fish is diseased, the following precautions are recommended:

Isolation: Isolate the affected fish to prevent the spread of disease.
Antibiotics: Use antibiotics like Oxytetracycline as prescribed by a veterinarian.
Water Quality: Improve water aeration and quality by checking pH, oxygen levels, and cleanliness.
Temperature Control: Ensure the water temperature is appropriate for the species.
These recommendations are dynamically generated and returned with the prediction result.
